## Introduction

### License 

This project is protected by a MIT License.

### Objectives 

The objective of this project is to provide a mail analysis tool allowing to no longer rely the analysis (and therefore the responsibility) of the analysis of mail on the knowledge of prevention of the reader but also on a tool.

This tool is intended to be as discreet as possible, it will then perform a preprocessing of the mail before it is opened by the user. This treatment will then assign a note to the mail, a note that corresponds to the credibility of the mail and therefore to the confidence that we can have in him.

One of the tools we use in this project is a Gmail mailbox that serves as the entry point for emails and serves as a witness to the proper functioning of our methods.

### Technologies 

This tool use ML ([Machine Learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning)) and NN ([Neural Network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network)) technologies to analysis email. 
To run this project you need to install packages which are :

* [numpy](https://numpy.org/) 
`pip install numpy`
* [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
`pip install pandas`
* [sklearn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
`pip install sklearn`
* [nltk](https://www.nltk.org/)
`pip install nltk`
* [ip2geotools](https://pypi.org/project/ip2geotools/)
`pip install ip2geotools`
* [requests](https://pypi.org/project/requests/2.7.0/) 
`pip install request`
* [tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) or [tensorflow_gpu](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/gpu) (if you have a gpu compatible)
`pip install `
`pip install tensorflow-gpu`
If you decide to use your gpu please install [Cuda](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-zone) (nowadays Cuda 10.0 is stabler than Cuda 10.*)
